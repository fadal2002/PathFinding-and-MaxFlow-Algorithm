A python script that implements Dijkstra's algorithm as well as Ford-Fulkerson algorithm in the creation of
a Pathfinding algorithm and a max flow algorithm.

Pathfinding algorithm :- the Pathfinding algorithm finds the shortest parth from point A to point B in a graph.
Max Flow algorithm:- the max flow algorithm calculates the maximum possible flow of a graph.
